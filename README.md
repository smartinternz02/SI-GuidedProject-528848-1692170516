## About
Brain tumour identification is a really challenging task in the early stages of life. These days the issue of brain tumour automatic identification is of great interest. A tumour is the unusual growth of the tissues. A brain tumour is a number of unnecessary cells growing in the brain or central spinal canal.  It is the unrestrained progress of cancer cells in any portion of the body. 
Deep learning techniques can be used in order to detect the brain tumour of a patient using the MRI images of a patientâ€™s brain. In this application, we are helping the doctors and patients to classify the type of scan for the specific image given with the help of Neural Networks and store the patient's data.
